Question: You are a travel planner AI. Your job is to create a day-by-day travel itinerary for the user based on their journey details. Start from the user’s current location and visit the destinations they’ve listed. Choose a travel route that makes sense geographically, minimizes travel distance, and (avoids backtracking !!!). Use the weather forecast at each location to help decide the best plan for each day.



For every day of the trip, organize your recommendations under the following clearly labeled sections:



Day [Number]: [Date]



Location to Visit:

Choose the most appropriate location to visit on this day, considering both the location’s position on the map and the weather. Briefly explain why this location was chosen.



Eating Experiences:

Suggest places to eat or food-related experiences in the location. These can include local dishes, famous food streets, recommended restaurants, or food-related events happening that day.



Activities:

Recommend indoor or outdoor things to do based on the weather and the user’s interests. These could include sightseeing, cultural experiences, nature activities, or indoor attractions.



Accommodation:

Recommend nearby places to stay that make sense given the day’s location and activities.



Safety Precautions:

Offer a short safety tip that’s relevant to the day’s weather, such as staying hydrated in hot weather, using rain protection, or wearing suitable footwear in wet areas.



Write each day’s plan as a clean and structured paragraph, keeping your tone informative and friendly. Avoid using markdown, bullet points, or special symbols."}]}}

If you venture outside, keep an eye on puddles and slippery areas, and wear appropriate footwear.\n\nDay 3: 2025-05-10\n\nLocation to Visit: Kuala Lipis, Pahang  \nThe weather will be overcast with mild temperatures, which makes it perfect for outdoor activities. This would be a good day to explore more of the natural surroundings of Kuala Lipis, such as visiting nearby parks or taking short walks in the cool weather.\n\nEating Experiences:  \nFor lunch, consider trying a local restaurant that serves freshly grilled seafood or chicken rice. Look for restaurants that offer traditional Malay, Chinese, or Indian fusion dishes, which are common in the area.\n\nActivities:  \nOn this day, the overcast weather makes it ideal for visiting outdoor attractions without the discomfort of the heat. You could head to nearby nature reserves or take a leisurely walk around the Taman Negara National Park if you enjoy nature. Another option is to explore the surrounding hills and river areas for peaceful views and scenic photography.\n\nAccommodation:  \nSince it's your last day in Kuala Lipis, you may want to book a stay at a more luxurious local resort if you prefer a more relaxing experience after a day of outdoor exploration.\n\nSafety Precautions:  \nAs you'll be outdoors in a relatively cool environment, be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and bring a light jacket in case it gets breezy. Although rain is unlikely, it’s still a good idea to keep an umbrella or raincoat handy, just in case.","status":true,"server_code":"dg"}
